I need a logo for my vs code extension - it's called "Codebook MD" and it makes it so the user can execute code blocks in a markdown file. Use a non-human character of some sort who looks friendly, subtly cool hair, and a black t-shirt. I'd like it to be fun and inviting. The title "Codebook MD" should be at the top and "[code-block] >> [execute!]" should be on the black t-shirt
