# Go: Installation and Hello World

## Installation

### If Go is already installed on your machine, you can test the installation by running the following command:

```go
fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
```

### To install Go on your machine, follow the instructions on the official website: https://golang.org/doc/install

1. Open the package file you downloaded and follow the prompts to install Go.
The package installs the Go distribution to /usr/local/go. The package should put the /usr/local/go/bin directory in your PATH environment variable. You may need to restart any open Terminal sessions for the change to take effect.

2. Verify that you've installed Go by opening a command prompt and typing the following command:

```shellscript
go version
```
